This new type of files are based in Mhtml code that was implemented before by rkzad (thanks for all your patiente :p)
Now me, Oracel and Rkzad got together to reimplement it to be more fast and flexible (mhtml2.txt file)

Some fast tips:
The mhtml file format consists in a normal html file, but where we can add mirc script code by adding some special tags
Here you have an example...

        >>>Sample code from index.mhtlm in recursion folder<<<

<html>
<head><title>mIRC Web Server</title></head>
<body bgcolor=white text=black link=blue alink=blue vlink=blue>
<font face=tahoma size=-1><center><img src=mws.png><br><br>
<?mhtml                                            <- here we notice the webserver that we are adding script code
  if ($isset(hello)) mhtml.print Hello, $getform(hello) $+ !<br>
?>                                                 <- here we notice that the script code has finished
<table border=2 bordercolor=#DADADA cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0><tr><td bgcolor=#EAEAEA>  <- then continue with the html code

;We can also include mhtml files inside of other mhtml files by doing
<?mhtml.inc include.mhtml      ;  <- notices the webserver that we are including a new mhtml file
                               ;   (same format has before), if the files doesn't exist it's like if it wasn't included

;For this last case you don't need to close nothing since the <?mhtml and the ?> are in the file include.
;Included files must not have </html> or the page will not apear the way you want it!!!

;You can add almost all type of mirc instructions in the mhtml code, but don't forget this code only runs in
;    server side, one example is this while loop

Nickname:<br>Address:<br>Idle:<br>Active channels:<br>Uptime:<br></font></div></td><td><font size=-1>
<?mhtml
  mhtml.print $+($iif(!$server,Not Connected,$server),<br>,$me,<br>,$iif($server,$host,-),<br>,$duration($idle),<br>)
  if ($chan(0)) {
    var %num = $chan(0)
    while %num {
      mhtml.print $chan(%num) $+ $iif(%num != 1,$chr(44))
      dec %num
    }
  }
  else mhtml.print None
  mhtml.print $+(<br>,$uptime(system,1))
?>
</font></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br>


The mhtml.print command must be used if you want to write something in the html page that is going to be sent to 
  the user that requested it.

more detailed information (with other commands) about mhtml v2 check the file mhtml2.txt

In this package i also provide code to upload files requiring. 
That code is in Upload code folder and it starts with the index.mhtml inside of that folder.

Notice that to run this type of files you need some extra processing power, i recomend 500Mz and 256MB ram
Also notice that antivirus software slow this type of processing like 
   hell (about 2 to 4 times slower)

Enjoy
