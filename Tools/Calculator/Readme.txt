      Version: 1.1
    Expecting: Version 1.2 soon!


Installation:

First off thank you for downloading and showing interest in my Calculator, it's
a very simple script to use, All you have to do is type:

    /load -rs calc.mrc

That only works if it's saved in the main directory, otherwise type:

    /load -rs DIRECTORY\calc.mrc

But if that doesn't work, go to the remotes section (ALT + R) then go to file
then load, and manually find the script.


Execution:

To run the script is very simple, right click in the channel window or in the
status window, and then click Calculator, a dialog should then pop up showing
you you're calculator!
