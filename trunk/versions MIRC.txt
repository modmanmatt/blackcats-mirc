    contain a regular expression. You must specify the $ event prefix
    to use this feature.

    on $*:TEXT:m/regular expression/switches:#:/echo message: $1-

    The 'm' and switches are optional. The // are required. If
    switches are used they must be standard PCRE switches, otherwise
    the match will fail. You can use switch 'S' to strip control
    codes from $1-.

124.On systems that support it, mIRC uses the new format for the
    browse for folder dialog, eg. $sdir() etc.
125.Added toolbar disconnect confirm option: requires two clicks
    to disconnect from a server, to prevent accidental disconnects.
126.Fixed $mp3() not returning correct .length for large mp3s.
127.The on CONNECTFAIL event now sets $1- to the error message.
128.Fixed $isdde() bug.
129.Added /color -s "scheme name" to allow changing of color schemes,
    and /color -l to reload color settings from mirc.ini.
130.Individual incoming lines (numeric 322 during a channel listing)
    can now be /halted in a script.
131.Fixed popup menu resources bug. Submenus which were merged due to
    duplicate names were not being freed afterwards.
132.Control+Enter with a /! prefixed command now triggers on INPUT.
133.Changing the flash settings in IRC options now applies them to
    all open windows (whose flash settings weren't manually enabled).
134.Fixed finger server bug.
135.Added $line().state property, returns selection state for a line
    in a @window listbox.

    mIRC is not the active application.
137.Fixed long script filenames not being displayed correctly in
    Editor dialog.
138.Added $didreg() identifier, same as $didwm() but uses regex.
139.Extended $fline(), where the T parameter can be 1 to use a
    listbox, 2 to use regex, or 3 for both.
140.Closing a debug @window now turns off debugging for that server.
141.Added "paste confirm" option to confirm dialog, displays warning
    you when you try to paste more than N lines of text to a window.
142.Added Key combination Alt+X to toggle maximized state of a
    window.
143.Binary variables no longer have an upper limit on the number of
    bytes that can be stored.
144.Added $compress(file|&bvar, blN) and $decompress(file|&bvar, blN)
    that compress/decompress files/binary variables. The result is
    raw compressed data. Where -b indicates a binary variable in the
    first parameter, and -lN sets a compression level of 1 to 6 (the
    default is 6).
145.Added /write -n switch, prevents /write from appending the line
    with a $crlf.
146.Using /hdec on a non-existent hash table item now sets it to a
    default value of -1.
147.Added /debug -i <...> [identifier] which calls the specified
    identifier before a debug line is logged. The return value of
    the identifier is used as the debug line.
148.The "enable" sounds option in the sounds dialog now affects most
    sounds, including highlight, notify, window/icon flashing, etc.
    Sound requests and Agents still need to be enabled/disabled
    individually. This does not affect the use of sound-related
    commands in scripts.
149.Pressing Control-C while marking text in a window now copies the
    text and cancels the mark process.
150.Added /server -pfoc switches, which prevent: perform, popup
    favorites folder, autojoin channels, and on connect event, on
    connecting to a server.
151.Time and date identifiers eg. $ctime() now return $null if an
    invalid time/date is specified.
152.Status window switchbar button now displays highlight state of
    associated windows hidden with Alt+F1.
153.Disconnecting via the file menu/toolbar/disconnect command now
    results in a soft disconnect, allowing any pending server info
    to be displayed. Incoming data will not trigger scripts, etc.
    during this time.
154.Added "show nicks on join" option to IRC options dialog.
155.Added "Alt+Z closes active window" option to keys dialog.
156.The $ticks identifier should now take account of the 49.7 day
    windows tick counter wrapping around to zero.

    lookup.

166.Added $comcall(name, alias,...) and $dllcall(filename, alias,...)
    identifiers, same format as $com() and $dll(), except these
    return immediately and allow the script to continue running. When
    the COM/DLL returns, the specified alias is called.
