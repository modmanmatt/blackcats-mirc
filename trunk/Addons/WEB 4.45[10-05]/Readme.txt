|	desc: Web Server for mirc v6.03, 6.12 - 6.16		   |
|	version: 4.40.3 for Php, Mhtml and Shoutcast		   |
|	released to site www.mircscripts.org		           |
:------------------------------------------------------------------:

Attention:
 This server runs server side languages Php and MHTML


Minimal requirements:
 I am maintaining the mirc 6.03 support but be aware that now only mirc 6.12+ runs Mhtml code and supports PHP use.
 I recommend the use of mirc 6.12+ since all TnTWS operations are extremely faster with this version.

 To run this addon with normal html files the minimal is 333Mhz with 196Mb Ram (its my slowest test machine)
 If you want to provide Mhtml files to users i recommend at least 500Mhz and 256MB Ram
 If you want to provide php files to users i recommend 1Ghz and 256MB Ram
 These are recommendations if you want to parse mhtml files and run php with a more or less decent speed!


Configuration: If you know what a web server is, this will be easy.

 Run it by typing /load -rs path_to_folder/web.mrc in mirc.
 Setup your first shared folder.
 Then start it by going to Menu bar -> Web server -> Commands -> Start.

 To run the web server with php and mysql, you will need php compiled for mysql and mysql running.
 You will also need to setup the php.exe location in the config dialog
 Some antivirus will allert you for the fact that it uses .vbs files.
 This are used in initialization of php environment vars and to run php himself.


Problems:
