Description:

    HDDspace is a simple addon that displays information about your
    harddrives current free, total and used space.
    It also includes a few other small functions that that can come in
    handy some times, and can be used freely* with your own stuff.

-----------------------------

Installation:

    Unzip the ZIP file into your mIRC directory and type:

    /load -rs HDDspace.mrc

    mIRC will ask you if it is ok to run some commands, click Yes,
    and the script will set variables to default and enter setup.


Removal:

    To uninstall the script type:

    /unload -rs HDDspace.mrc

-----------------------------

Usage:

    When you load the script a menu (HDD's) is added to your popups.
    So you can use them to quickly display your HDDspace.
    The same thing is also availible through the /HDDspace command:

      /HDDspace             returns info on all disks while for example
      /HDDspace C           only returns info on disk C:

    As you can see you can display info about all drives using HDDspace
    without parameters, or you could use it together with a driveletter
    parameter to show info about that particular drive only.


    If you want to change the colors or other stuff you can enter setup
    using the menu in Commands/HDDspace Settings, or by typing:

      /HDDspace settings



    For further information look inside the script file!

-----------------------------

Troubleshooting:

    If something gets messed up, you can always enter setup and easily
    correct the errors.

    If it get totaly out of hand (which I doubt) you can unload the
    script and load it again to regain the default settings.

* If you want to use any of my functions in a public script I'd
  appreciate if you gave me some credits =)


Well well, I think that covers most of it hehe =) If you still have
questions you can ask me at IRC. I'll be in #serske most of the time.



Have Fun // Leif
