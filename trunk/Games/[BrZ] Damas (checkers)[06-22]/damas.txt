     :  (3) Catching
     :
     :...................


  - It's possible to catch backward using any piece

  !!WARNING!!

  - You have to catch pieces. If you try to move any piece and it doesn't
    move, see if it's possible to catch any of your opponent piece

  - If it's possible to catch 3 piece in 1 turn you'll have to do it

  - If you catch with a king, and if you still can catch another piece in the same
  turn, you'll have to do it.  Example: You catch an opponent  piece and there are
  still 3 free  squares but if another catch is  possible, you must catch, or your
  turn won't finnish.
    
    If you don't follow the rules, you won't be able to move your pieces. So don't
 think it's a bug.
