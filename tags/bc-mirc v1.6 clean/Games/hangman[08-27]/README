mIRC-Hangman v1.0 by Darkie

Whats this?
-----------

This is a simple game of hangman which uses picture windows.

Loading
-------

Type /load -rs hangman.mrc to load.  If you saved it to another directory,
specify it.

Now that it's loaded...
-----------------------

Right-click on any window and select mIRC-Hangman->play to play.  When
you play, it selects a word from a list.  To edit the list, right-click
and select mIRC-Hangman->Edit word list.

To unload
---------

Right-click on any window and select mIRC-Hangman->Unload.

Any plans?
----------

Here are the plans for future releases of this addon:
* The ability to change fonts, etc.
* Got any suggestions? Let me know and I'll consider it

Any comments?
