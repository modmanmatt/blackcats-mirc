--ANOTHER UPDATE--
-Added two sounds.. one for when you get a new high score(someone has to cheer you on) and another when you hover over a blank space.. you can turn sounds on or off with the checkbox under the 'New Game' button
-Added a progress bar for when your score is being calculated
-Changed the look of the 'New Game' button and the logo in the top left
-Added hover effects to blank spaces
-Changed the colors of the arrows at the end of the game, fades from green to red according to the colors in the list of hands where the point values are, the more red the arrow is, the higher the point value
-Changed the way the game changes colors using the colorbar at the bottom..this will no longer end your game and reopen the window, you can change colors anytime during your game and you will not lose anything
-Added a reset button for your high score

--UPDATED ONCE MORE--
-Just one thing in this one, as you can see there is a color bar below the game board, that allows you to choose which colors are used throughout the game.  You can now choose either red, yellow, green, gray, or blue, instead of just having to deal with just green.(don't ask why, just gives some sort of variety)
-NOTICE!-If you click on one of the colored boxes at the bottom, it closes the game and reopens it to the new color.
-AGAIN!-Clicking a colored box WILL RESTART YOUR GAME!

--UPDATED AGAIN--
-Just some color added
-Discard added, can now discard and two (2) unwanted cards as they come up

--UPDATED--
-At the end of the game, you will see arrows, and little numbers, the arrows show which row/column/diagonal you got the hand in, and the number is the number representing which type of hand you have(numbers are assigned by the point value table)
-Now unsets all variables when unloaded
-Now has popup menus
