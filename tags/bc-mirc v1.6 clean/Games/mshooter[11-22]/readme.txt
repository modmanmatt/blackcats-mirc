Missile shooter (beta version)


Heya, this is a kind of shoot'em up where you have 
to defeat a super-morpheable-plane that want to take
control of the universe. The game is made 100% from
picwin draw* commands and absolutely no images were
used in the creation of this game.


This isn't a fun game, don't except too much :)
